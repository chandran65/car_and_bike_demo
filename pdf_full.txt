values for the attribute, the default variant’s attribute to be shown or the bot should 
ask for follow-up questions like “Do you want to know the details of Nexon Smart or 
Nexon Pure?”

like “The boot space of Tata Nexon is 382L”

Acceptance Criteria 
- The chatbot should provide the real time information with the updated details

“Between 5 Lakh to 10 Lakh” and related queries should be converted to a structured 
price filter (min – max) - The chatbot should apply filters on the user intent. When users add more constraints, 
the chatbot should map them to the appropriate filters, examp le “automatic”,  
“manual” ->Transmission; “SUV”, “Hatchback” -> “Body type” and so on

that no exact match is found

thread, like “only SUVs” or “make it automatic”, the chatbot should apply refinement

comparison, “Creta vs Seltos vs Nexon”. Car vs Bike Comparison queries should be 
denied as the platform doesn't support cross domain comparison. 
- The chatbot should return a structured, easy to read comparison; the output must 
clearly show side by side differences including prices, Engine details, fuel type, 
transmission, mileage/range, power & torque, Key features, safety rating, etc. 
- The chatbot should highlight the key differences, not just provide the raw data dump 
to the users 
- The chatbot should be able to handle partial attributes. If the user asks, “Compare 
mileage of Creta & Seltos” or “Compare ground clearance of Nexon and Creta” , the 
chatbot should return only that attribute - The chatbot should have the ability to handle ambiguous or unknown models. If the 
model's name is unclear, it should ask the user  follow-up questions. If the model 
doesn’t exist in the database, the bot should inform the user 
- The chatbot should be able to handle the errors like API failures, it should show texts 
like “Please try sometime later”

So that  I can make a confident & well-informed purchase decision without browsing 
multiple pages

intents such as “Which SUV shall I buy?”, “Best scooters for daily commute” ,

vehicles listed on the website in the respective pages, the recommendations should 
come from the platform DB, internal expert opinion, news articles & aggregated 
insights 
- The chatbot should collect missing preferences through follow-up questions. If user 
lacks required details like budget, use case, fuel preferences, seating etc., the 
chatbot should ask contextual follow-up questions 
- Each recommendation should include – Why this model fits user’s needs, pros cons, 
what type of user suits it best & how it compares to the alternatives.  
o Example – Tata Nexon – Strong build (5 Star safety), punchy engine options, 
good for family & city commute
