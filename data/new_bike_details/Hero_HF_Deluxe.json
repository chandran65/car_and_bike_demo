  "verdict": "One of the most cost effective products from Hero MotoCorp, the Hero HF Deluxe features a robust design that is liked by all, while offering a comfortable stance that helps commuting less stressful. It's designed for frugal running costs, as well as a low price point. But the lack of modern features and the noisy engine are its major flaws apart from the absence of disc brakes which is now standard on most products in this segment.",
