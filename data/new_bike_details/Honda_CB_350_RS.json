  "verdict": "The Honda CB350RS offers quite a likeable modern classic, entry-level roadster in its segment. It does skip a few features from the Honda H'Ness CB 350 it's based on, and the price difference may not really make sense but it is a likeable motorcycle and is worth considering for anyone looking for a 'thumping' motorcycle that's not Royal Enfield, but is in the same price and performance bracket. The CB350RS competes with the Jawa 42 as well.",
