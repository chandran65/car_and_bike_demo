    "Introduction": [
      "Skoda Auto India officially launched the new Octavia RS on October 17, 2025 at Rs. 49.99 lakh (ex-showroom).",
      "However, this price was for the first 100 units which got instantly sold out.",
      "The Octavia RS is a high-performance version of the standard sedan, marking the return of the RS variant to India.",
      "It is offered in a single variant, five colours, and with a single engine and transmission option.",
      "Deliveries of the first lot were scheduled to begin on 6 November and later slots not confirmed.",
      "The original RS variant of the Octavia was discontinued in April 2023 due to new BS6 Phase 2 emission standards.",
      "Currently in its fourth generation, the Octavia RS is offered in India as a Completely Built Unit (CBU)."
    ],
    "Exterior": [
      "Prospective buyers can opt for the 2025 Skoda Octavia RS in five colours such as Race Blue, Velvet Red, Candy White, Magic Black, and the signature Mamba Green.",
      "The RS differentiates itself from the standard Octavia with subtle tweaks and different badging.",
      "For example, the bright Mamba Green is exclusively for the RS, while a special RS badge adorns the front grille and tailgate.",
      "The bumpers look sportier and given the RS suffix, this version of the Octavia rides 15mm lower than the standard Octavia.",
      "Moreover, the sports sedan features a sports exhaust system with black tailpipes as standard.",
      "Other exterior highlights include all-LED lights, 19-inch dual-tone alloys, dynamic turn indicators, and red brake calipers."
