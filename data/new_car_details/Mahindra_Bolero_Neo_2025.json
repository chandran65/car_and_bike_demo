    "Introduction": [
      "The iconic Mahindra Bolero Neo was refreshed in October 2025.",
      "Starting at a price of Rs. 8.49 lakh, it features a series of cosmetic and functional upgrades."
    ],

      "Existing monotone colour options include Diamond White, Stealth Black, and Rocky Beige.",
      "Along with the Pearl White, the new colour options can be had in a dual-tone shade as well.",
      "The other key highlights on the SUV include DRLs integrated in the headlight module, dual-tone ORVMs with electric adjustment, and 15/16-inch alloys.",
      "Mahindra offers the Bolero Neo across five variants, namely, N4, N8, N10, N10 (O), and N11."
    ],
    "Interior": [
      "Inside its cabin, the interior colourways include Lunar Grey for the top-spec variant and Mocha Brown for the others.",
      "The facelifted Bolero Neo continues to get the seven-seat layout without any changes.",
      "However, there's an update in terms of the infotainment system, which supports wired Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.",
      "The SUV gets a new steering wheel, new upholstery, foldable second row, and front and second row armrests.",
      "Feature-wise, it is also equipped with rear wiper and defogger, ISOFIX mounts, ABS and EBD, rear view camera, USB-C ports, and the brand's RideFlo tech.",
      "As a part of the latest updates, cruise control has also been added as a part of the package."
    ],
    "Powertrain": [
      "Mechanically, the Bolero Neo's engine options remain unchanged with an RWD configuration.",
      "The Bolero Neo derives power from the same 1.5-litre mHawk100 diesel engine producing 100bhp and 260Nm torque.",

    ]
  },
  "verdict": "The Bolero Neo offers more value compared to the Bolero Classic, boasting enhanced features and advanced mechanicals. Though it compromises on interior refinement and second-row comfort as compared to other vehicles, its rugged capability and drivability make it apt for tackling challenging roads. It continues to be positioned as an accessible lifestyle SUV under Rs. 10 lakh, retains the Bolero heritage, and hence appeals to budget-conscious buyers.",
