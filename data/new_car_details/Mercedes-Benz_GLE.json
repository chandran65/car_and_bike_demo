  "expert_review": {
    "design_styling": "While retaining its signature look, the GLE now boasts a more aerodynamic and sleek design. The front fascia, seemingly inspired by the X-Class pick-up truck, showcases an octagonal radiator grille adorned with a chrome-plated under guard, while the bonnet proudly flaunts the power dome character line. Its multi-beam LED headlamps promise visibility for over 650 meters. The extended wheelbase, 80mm more than its predecessor, complements the novel design and looks proportionate as expected. Offered with diverse tire sizes ranging from 19 to 22 inches, its rear design exudes compactness with rounded contours and slender LED tail lamps."
  },
  "verdict": "The fourth-generation Mercedes-Benz GLE surpasses its predecessor in every dimension, offering enhanced capability, cutting-edge technology, agility, and aesthetics. Mercedes-Benz has meticulously refined every aspect, introducing numerous segment-first features. It strikes the perfect balance between sophistication and ruggedness, blending elegance with robustness seamlessly. The interior is lavishly appointed, meeting high specifications and equipped with an array of gadgets and creature comforts to satisfy even the most discerning and desirous. It's a vehicle that doesn't just meet expectations but redefines them.",
