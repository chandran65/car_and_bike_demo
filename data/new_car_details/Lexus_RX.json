  "expert_review": {
    "design_styling": "The aesthetic appeal of the Lexus RX450h is arresting right from the first glance. Take, for instance, the prominent X-shaped front grille, a defining element that’s not just a design feature but a statement. It demands attention, and yet, it’s seamlessly integrated into the vehicle’s overall façade, giving it an almost avant-garde feel. The flanks are sculpted, chiseled to precision, lending the SUV a muscular silhouette that complements its otherwise sleek design. The windows come with a steeply raked angle, making it appear as if the car has been cut from a single block of futuristic vision. LED lighting systems are a highlight on the vehicle’s exterior, not just serving a functional purpose but enhancing its luxurious and modern aura."
  },
  "verdict": "The RX450h is a comfortable long-distance cruiser; the ride deteriorates a bit with the F-Sport package, but the same package improves the somewhat cumbersome handling of the standard model. There is a suite of assistance and telematics systems, and the stereo system, in typical Lexus fashion, is top-notch. We wish the cabin were better isolated, but altogether, this is a solid and well-built performer.",
