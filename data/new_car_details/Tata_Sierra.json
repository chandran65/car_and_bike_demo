  "whats_new": {
    "Introduction": [
      "Tata Motors launched the new Sierra in India on November 25, 2025.",
      "Earlier, the carmaker had shown its concept version, prototypes, and the pre-production versions.",
      "However, this is the production version of the SUV that will be slotted above the Curvv, and below the Harrier and Safari.",
      "With an introductory pricing of Rs. 11.5 lakh, Tata Motors has ensured to make a strong statement for aggressive pricing.",
      "However, it will be clear when the entire variant-wise price break-up is made available.",
      "Bookings scheduled to start on 16 December 2025, and deliveries after 16 January, 2026.",
      "The Tata Sierra will go up against the Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos, Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara, Victoris, and the likes."
    ],
    "Exterior": [
      "This production-spec Sierra is like the concept, while borrowing elements from the original SUV.",
      "Unlike the concept and the pre-production versions showcased earlier, the production version gets a lot of new features.",
      "It boasts an upright front fascia with a confident stance, short overhangs, and a strong shoulder line.",
      "Though the new Sierra doesn’t have a curved rear glasshouse section, it's styled to look like that.",
      "The SUV is equipped with LED headlights with a full-width LED light bar.",
      "Other highlights include flush-fitting door handles and two-tone alloy wheels."
    ],
    "Interior": [
      "Inside, the new Sierra is a big departure in terms of the exiting styling in Tata cars.",
      "The Sierra comes equipped with a triple-screen layout.",
      "The latter comprises a digital instrument cluster, central touchscreen, and an additional screen on the passenger side.",
      "Though some elements are carried over from existing siblings, these strike a balance between utility and luxury.",
      "Some notable features include a new centre console, HUD, and a 12-speaker JBL sound system with a sound bar.",
      "It also gets dual-zone climate control, 360-degree camera, powered and ventilated front seats.",
      "Interestingly, the top-spec variants also boast connected car technology and Level 2 ADAS."
    ],
    "Powertrain": [
      "Tata Motors will offer the Sierra in petrol, diesel, and electric powertrains as well.",
      "This includes the brand's new 1.5-litre GDi turbo petrol producing 158bhp and 255Nm.",
      "This engine comes only with a six-speed automatic transmission.",
      "However, customers can opt for the Sierra with a 1.5-litre petrol engine.",
      "This NA petrol produces 105bhp and 145Nm and can be had with either a six-speed manual or a seven-speed DCT automatic.",
