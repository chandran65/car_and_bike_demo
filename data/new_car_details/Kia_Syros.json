  "whats_new": {
    "Introduction": [
      "The Kia Syros is the latest sub-four metre SUV that is slotted between the Sonet and the Seltos.",
      "This new compact SUV is based on a reinforced K1 platform.",
      "Though it has a boxy design, inside, it promises space comparable to SUVs from a higher segment.",
      "It is available across various powertrains, transmission options, and price points."
    ],
    "Exterior": [
      "The Kia Syros doesn't look like any of its siblings in the India line-up.",
      "And this polarising design will draw subjective opinions even if it’s a bold move from Kia.",
      "Yet, there are some typical Kia design elements like the star map LED lights seen on more of its recent siblings.",
      "It boasts these ice cube headlamps with DRLs next to it, which double up as side indicators.",
      "The side profile shows off flush-fitting retractable door handles, thick B-pillars, and roof rails.",
      "It gets flared wheel arches that house two-tone alloy wheels.",
      "Even the tail lamps are vertically stacked, with DRLs on the topmost section and the main unit in the bumper.",
      "Then, there's a silver slab-like faux skid plate finishing the look."
    ],
    "Interior": [
      "Inside the Syros, its dashboard design is modern yet simple, with horizontal air-con vents and a huge 30-inch screen taking centre stage.",
      "This 30-inch dual-screen layout houses a digital instrument cluster and a touchscreen infotainment system.",
      "Notably, there's even a five-inch screen in between for the air-con controls.",
      "Moreover, there's also this new flat-bottom steering wheel with an asymmetric Kia logo.",
      "Other features offered on the Syros include an eight-speaker Harman Kardon sound system, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, and wireless charging.",
      "Noteworthy mentions include ambient lighting, ventilated seats, connected car features with remote window ventilation, rear AC vents, and a rear sunshade among many other features.",
      "On the safety front, the Syros is equipped with a plethora of safety equipment.",
      "The Syros is feature-packed with a 360-degree camera, six airbags, ESC, hill-start, disc brakes on all four corners, and ADAS."
    ],
    "Powertrain": [
      "The petrol Kia Syros is offered with a 1.0-litre turbo-petrol engine.",
      "This mill produces 118bhp and 172Nm of torque.",
      "It domes mated to either with a six-speed manual or a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission.",
      "On the other hand, there's even a 1.5-litre diesel motor.",
      "This unit churns out 114bhp and 250Nm of torque.",
      "This oil-burner comes mated either to a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission."
