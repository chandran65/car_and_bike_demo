    "Introduction": [
      "Honda launched the third generation of the Amaze in late 2024 without discontinuing the second-generation.",
      "In its latest iteration, the petrol-only sedan gets a new look, refreshed cabin, new features, and technology.",
      "In fact, in 2025, Honda introduced a new Crystal Black Pearl exterior shade for the third generation Amaze as well."
    ],
    "Exterior": [
      "Regarding changes outside, the front styling now looks like the Elevate with the hexagonal grille.",
      "The rectangular headlamps add to the similarity with all LED units in the top-spec version.",
      "Now, the sedan's width has also increased by 38mm than before for a more progressive and wider stance.",
      "Besides, the ground clearance has also gone up from 170mm to 172mm.",
      "It rides on 15-inch dual-tone alloy wheels, which are again a bit like its elder sibling — the City."
    ],
    "Interior": [
      "Inside, the seating layout and design is identical to the predecessor Amaze.",
      "It continues to get a 416-litre boot space still making it the compact sedan with the highest cargo volume in its segment.",
      "Feature-wise, the latest tech includes cruise control, push-button start, and automatic climate control.",
      "Unlike big screens these days, it gets a seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.",
      "On the safety front, it gets six airbags, ISOFIX mounts, and ABS with EBD.",
      "Apart from the various safety assist technologies, Honda has equipped the higher variants of the Amaze with ADAS functions through Honda Sensing.",
      "This makes it not only the first-in-segment to have it, but also the most affordable passenger car in India to have this automated safety technology."
    ],
    "Powertrain": [
      "Post 2024, there are no mechanical changes to the Amaze.",
      "It continues to be powered by a 1.2-litre, four-cylinder petrol engine.",
