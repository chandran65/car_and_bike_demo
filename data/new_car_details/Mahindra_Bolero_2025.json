  "expert_review": {
    "design_styling": "Mahindra Bolero’s design is one that has withstood the test of time. Even despite evolving over the years, it continues to boast a commanding presence. The Bolero’s design is a harmonious blend of the traditionalSUV caraesthetics with a hint of modernity. The fascia is dominated by a sturdy multi-slat grille, further accentuated by a rugged metal bumper. Large, sweeping halogen headlamps not only ensure clear night-time visibility but also add to its imposing presence. At the rear, the tailgate-mounted spare wheel acts as both a functional and design element, underscoring its tough-as-nails attitude."
  },
  "verdict": "The Bolero is a robust and dependable choice for people who value durability and straightforward maintenance more than contemporary amenities and comfort. The SUVs strengths lie in handling rugged terrains and rural driving conditions, hence preferred in Tier II & III markets. However, an outdated interior, sub-standard quality, and lack of finesse make it less appealing to buyers in urban developments.",
