  "whats_new": {
    "Introduction": [
      "The Toyota Vellfire is a luxury MPV which was first introduced in India in August, 2023.",
      "Its 2025 version has a petrol-electric hybrid powertrain that offers smooth and linear power delivery.",

    "Exterior": [
      "The Vellfire stands out due to its sheer length of over five metres and the road presence.",
      "Its fascia features a six-slat grille and a sculpted, upright nose.",
      "The headlamp setup integrates sleek LED DRLs and a three-lens LED for better visibility.",
      "Its body has creases and a distinctive zig-zag window line, alongside subtle chrome accents on door handles.",
      "The Vellfire’s alloy wheels feature a dual-tone machine finish.",
      "At the rear, the connected LED tail lamps and a chunky bumper maintain its sleek look."
    ],
    "Interior": [

    ]
  },
  "verdict": "In case you were wondering about the rivals of the Toyota Vellfire, it isn't the Kia Carnival. Toyota is billing the Vellfire not as a people mover but as a premium luxury car. The car has a lot to offer and is genuinely comfortable, especially for the rear passengers but it has its work cut out as it sits between the Kia Carnival at one end of the MPV spectrum and the Mercedes-Benz V-Class on the other.",
