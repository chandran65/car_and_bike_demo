  "expert_review": {
    "design_styling": "From the moment you lay eyes on it, the A 45 S announces its presence with an elegant ferocity. The AMG-specific grille and the revamped LED daytime running lights serve as subtle updates from the outgoing model. With 19-inch AMG alloy wheels and a glossy black exterior replete with bold rear diffusers and quad-tip exhausts, this hot hatch appears every bit an AMG as its larger siblings. The all-black rear Aerofoil accessory adds a zesty touch and an aerodynamic edge. It’s not just a car; it’s a showstopper on wheels."
  },
  "verdict": "The AMG A45 S of course is the world's hottest. We say hottest, we mean to say powerful, because there will certainly be leaving a trail of fire as it shoots across the streets. All four wheels get power thanks to the 4Matic all-wheel drive system and it's the 8-speed dual clutch transmission that provides the power to them. The A45 features six driving modes - Comfort, Sport, Sport+, Slippery, Individual and Race. It can do a 0-100 kmph run in just 3.9 seconds and that's fast, really fast!",
