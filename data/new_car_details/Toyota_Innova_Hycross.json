  "expert_review": {
    "design_styling": "When you lay eyes on the exterior of the Innova HyCross, you’ll witness a profound shift in design, pushing it into contemporary and chic terrains. It wouldn’t be surprising if it’s momentarily mistaken for a robust SUV, especially with its assertive front profile drawing cues from the latest Toyota Hilux pick-up. A hexagonal-shaped honeycomb mesh grille framed by generous chrome highlights dominates the front. LED DRLs and LED headlamps flank this centerpiece, all contained within sharply creased contours that add a dynamic edge. The ‘T’ logo confidently sits in the middle, flanked by chrome-finished ‘Innova’ lettering on the hood. The bumpers are no slouch either, robustly designed and integrated with more chrome to emphasize its SUV persona. The side profile holds true to its MPV heritage but adds a dash of flair with its new 18-inch alloy wheels and tapered rear end. The smaller windows and a sweeping roofline further accentuate its SUV characteristics. Toyota has also reduced the quarter glass for the third row, perhaps to match the vehicle’s now sportier aesthetic. But what truly sets it apart are the squarish and heavily flared wheel arches that give it a robust look while also freeing up interior space. With the ‘Hybrid’ label tastefully displayed, there is no mistaking this vehicle’s green credentials."

  "verdict": "The Toyota Innova HyCross takes the Toyota Innova success story forward in a great way. It’s a feature loaded car that guarantees great comfort and its only got better with this new generation. Another highlight is the high fuel efficiency, courtesy the hybrid powertrain and the ride quality is as supple as It always was. Too bad that it feels a bit expensive and there’s no Diesel motor now.",
