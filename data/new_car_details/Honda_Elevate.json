  "whats_new": {
    "Introduction": [
      "Honda's latest mid-size SUV, the Elevate, was first launched in India in September 2023.",
      "While the SUV hasn't changed much, the carmaker has been making changes to it to keep it fresh amidst the competition.",
      "The upgrades include exterior styling elements, new interior themes, and special editions.",
      "Amongst these is the latest range-topping version of the Elevate called the Elevate ADV Edition.",
      "Apart from the existing Black Editions, the ADV variant brings a sportier look and several unique cosmetic enhancements."
    ],
    "Exterior": [
      "The Elevate is a proper mid-size SUV with proportions like its rivals including the Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos, and the likes.",
      "Honda has kept the design intact with just a little nip and tuck to keep it afresh.",
      "For example, the standard Elevate Black Edition comes with chrome and silver highlights.",
      "On the other hand, the Signature Black Edition gets full blacked-out styling with a new grille.",
      "Now, the latest ADV Edition stands out with exclusive styling upgrades.",
      "These include a glossy black Alpha-Bold Plus front grille and an orange-accented hood decal.",
      "It also gets black roof rails, ORVMs, and black alloy wheels with orange highlights.",
      "Other highlights include an orange fog lamp garnish, ADV badges, and a rear bumper skid plate with orange accents."
    ],
    "Interior": [
      "The Elevate seating layout and design is more or less the same ever since its launch, expect for some cosmetic changes.",
      "For example, the biggest addition is in the form of the top-spec ZX variant, which now gets an ivory interior theme with leatherette upholstery, soft-touch inserts on the doors and dashboard.",
      "Prospective buyers can also opt for a 360-degree surround vision camera and seven-colour ambient lighting.",
      "Meanwhile, the V and VX trims feature black fabric upholstery with ivory inserts, in place of the earlier shadow beige theme.",
      "In contrast, the Elevate ADV Edition boasts an all-black cabin with orange stitching and accents on the seats, AC knobs, and gear console.",
      "Another unique highlight is the first-in-Honda ADV Terrain Pattern backlit illuminated instrument panel.",
      "Here, even the seats feature embossed ADV logos for added appeal and to stand apart from the standard version.",
      "Moreover, the Black and Signature Black Editions continue to feature all-black interiors with leatherette seats and soft-touch materials.",
      "On the safety front, the Elevate top-spec variants including the ADV Edition come equipped a lot of features.",
      "For example, there's a Honda Sensing ADAS suite, including collision mitigation braking, lane-keep assist, adaptive cruise control, and more.",
      "Otherwise, the standard safety features include six airbags, lane watch camera, hill start assist, vehicle stability control, and ISOFIX child seat mounts."
    ],
    "Powertrain": [
      "Honda had launched the Elevate with a 1.5-litre i-VTEC petrol engine.",
      "It comes mated to either a six-speed manual gearbox or a CVT.",
      "Even the new ADV Edition carries forward this familiar 1.5-litre engine.",
      "Notably, the CVT automatic is a seven-step transmission with paddle shifters."
