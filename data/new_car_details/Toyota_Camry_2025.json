  "expert_review": {
    "design_styling": "A product of meticulous craftsmanship and innovative design philosophy, the eighth-generation Camry hybrid is visually striking. Drawing certain inspirations fromLexus, Toyota’s luxury arm, the Camry showcases a dominant front grille which is quite different when compared to theLexus ES. LED headlamps coupled with the LED DRLs carve a signature aesthetic. With sleek curves gracefully flowing along the sides and sculpted lines on the hood, the Camry doesn’t shy away from flaunting its newfound muscular stance. Continuing the design narrative, the rear mirrors the cohesion seen at the front. Slim tail lamps and subtle design elements encapsulate the modern ethos Toyota intended for the new Camry. The distinct blue hue on the Toyota badges subtly yet confidently signals the hybrid nature of the vehicle."
  },
  "verdict": "The hybrid then takes the fight to the Passat and even the Superb here, which, though priced lower, do not get to boast of a hybrid powertrain. With the new generation of the Camry then, you certainly see Toyota taking a leap in terms of looks, drivability and sustainability too. It's the right mixture then, and you could hear even Zeus and Prometheus say this when demi-gods were born. So you see, even the Gods loved hybrids; we, on the other hand are mere mortals.",
