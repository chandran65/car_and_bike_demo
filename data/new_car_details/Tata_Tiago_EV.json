    "design_styling": "The Tata Tiago EV is a statement of Tata’s dedication to intertwining style with sustainability. Its design ethos mirrors a progressive shift from traditional aesthetics to a futuristic and EV-centric appeal. The front grille of the Tiago EV is an eye-catcher. Unlike the standard Tiago, this one has been reimagined, keeping in mind its electric credentials, showcasing a predominantly closed design for the grille, and the headlight section embellished with a tri-arrow pattern on the edges. This pattern is echoed on the front bumper’s central air-vent, adding a touch of symmetry to the design. The electric vehicle distinction is further accentuated with a strategically placed EV badge on the grille, which is complimented by the blue-tinted trim highlight beneath it, a trademark of all Tata EVs. Rounding off the design upgrades is the Tiago’s distinct wheel pattern, setting it apart from its sedan sibling, the Tigor EV. Each element in its design underscores Tata’s ambition to harmonise sophistication with functionality, ensuring the Tiago EV doesn’t just perform well but also turns heads on the road."

  "verdict": "If you're still undecided about buying an electric car and have concerns about things like range anxiety or driving dynamics, the Tiago EV addresses these well. It gives you the confidence of using an electric vehicle and doesn't cost a bomb. The hatch comes across as a good alternative in the market especially for urban commutes. If you’re looking to adopt electric mobility at an affordable cost, this is your safe bet.",
