  "expert_review": {
    "design_styling": "One glance at the Tigor, and its lineage is evident. It draws major design elements from the Tata Tiago hatchback. The front boasts a hexagonal grille flanked by twin-barrel headlamps housing projector low beams and halogen highs. Unfortunately, the design lacks LED daytime running lights. The petrol Tigor flaunts 15-inch dual-tone diamond-cut wheels, while the diesel settles for 14-inch ones. However, the real stunner is its rear – a fusion of coupe-like roofline and a seamlessly integrated boot. Noteworthy are the innovative high-mounted spoiler with an end-to-end tail lamp and the 3D tail lamps. The sporty rear bumper adds the final touch, making the Tigor a good looking sub-4-metre sedan in India."
  },
  "verdict": "The Tigor rides and handles well, is very well equipped, spacious and frankly, thoughtfully engineered. And although we wish the engines were a little peppier and more refined, one of the biggest reasons we think the Tigor will be popular will be because of how it looks.  As a package, the Tigor is extremely well suited for any Indian family who wants to upgrade from an entry level hatchback but still wants a three box design.",
