    ],
    "Volvo XC90 - Exterior": [
      "Something so confident about the XC90 is a bold, rectangular grille with a Volvo logo.",
      "Its headlights resemble ‘Thor’s hammer’ making it a signature styling element of the SUV.",

      "At the rear, there are Volvo’s tall-signature headlamps that are vertical and frame the SUV.",
      "Moreover, simple badges and a neat tailgate keep it looking tidy and upscale.",
      "A big panoramic sunroof blends smoothly into the roof, while integrated roof rails add practicality for carrying extra luggage."
    ],
    "Volvo XC90 – Interior": [
      "On a clean, simple dashboard, there’s a large vertical touchscreen taking centre stage.",
      "Most buttons are kept minimal so that things look uncluttered.",
      "High‑quality materials within the cabin provide a premium Scandinavian experience.",
      "Comfortable and supportive seats in all rows ensure a relaxed drive on a long journey.",

      "An ambient lighting adds a touch of colour to the cabin and softly lights up.",

    ]
  },
  "verdict": "The Volvo delivers an impressive performance without directly contesting the V6 or V8 SUVs. Its combined output of 400bhp, sourced from the electric motor and the 4-cylinder engine, is commendably robust. The vehicle operates smoothly and, when switched to Pure Mode, can cover slightly over 40 kilometres solely on electric power. Additionally, it offers instant torque, thanks to the electric motor's ability to provide maximum torque from a standstill, ensuring responsive and dynamic acceleration right from the get-go.",
