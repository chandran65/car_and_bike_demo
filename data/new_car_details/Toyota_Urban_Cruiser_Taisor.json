    "Introduction": [
      "Toyota's collaboration with Maruti Suzuki brought in many cross-badged vehicles including the Taisor.",
      "It's indeed a rebadged version of the Maruti Suzuki Fronx.",
      "It was launched in April 2024 and earlier called the Urban Cruiser Taisor.",
      "The carmaker offers this Fronx-based crossover in two petrol engine options.",
      "As for the five variants, they are named as E, S, S+, G, and V, with prices starting at Rs. 7.74 lakh (ex-showroom)."
    ],
    "Exterior": [
      "The Taisor has a unique look with a different front grille in line with Toyota's design language.",
      "It's flanked by LED DRLs on either side, which again are very different than the Fronx.",
      "The silhouette is identical but the Taisor rides on a different pattern of 16-inch alloy wheels.",
      "At the back, redesigned taillamp clusters and an LED light bar complete the look."
    ],
    "Interior": [
      "As for the interior of the Taisor, the design and cabin layout is like the Fronx.",
      "Apart from the Toyota logo, the dashboard design, interior layout, features, and equipment are carried over from the Fronx.",
      "The Taisor gets a nine-inch touchscreen infotainment system that supports wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.",
      "Other notable equipment includes automatic climate control, cruise control, wireless charger, and a 360-degree camera."
    ],
    "Powertrain": [
      "The Taisor is available with the same engine options as the Fronx.",
      "This includes a 1.2-litre petrol engine that produces 89bhp and 113Nm of torque.",
      "The other is a 1.0-litre turbo-petrol engine that churns 99bhp and 148Nm.",
      "Both engines come mated to a five-speed manual gearbox as standard.",
      "However, the 1.0-litre engine is offered with an optional six-speed automatic.",
      "Meanwhile, the naturally aspirated unit can be had with a five-speed AMT.CNG buyers also get a factory-fitted CNG option for the Taisor."
