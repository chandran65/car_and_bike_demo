    "Introduction": [
      "Mahindra launched the new XEV 9S in India on 27 November, 2025.",
      "It is the brand's first three-row electric offering for the Indian market.",
      "Prices start at Rs. 19.95 lakh (ex-showroom) for the Pack One XEV 9s, and go up to Rs. 29.5 lakh for the Pack Three.",
      "The XEV 9s is essentially an EV derivative of the XUV700.",
      "It joins the XEV 9e, BE 6, and the XUV400 in the brand’s electric SUV portfolio."
    ],
    "Exterior": [
      "The Mahindra XEV 9S looks similar to the XUV700, but with a revamped exterior, especially the front.",
      "It gets a blanked-out front grille, L-shaped LED DRLs, a light bar, and vertically stacked projector units in the headlight module.",
      "The silhouette is like the XUV700 with flush-fitting door handles.",
      "However, the XEV 9S rides on a fresh set of alloys with aero inserts.",
      "Moreover, it boasts roof rails, Mahindra Electric logo on both ends, and a shark-fin antenna."
    ],
    "Interior": [
      "Inside, the seven-seat XEV 9S boasts a three-screen setup on the dashboard.",
      "This is paired to a Harman Kardon music system and, in fact, there are screens for second row occupants as well.",
      "The Mahindra electric SUV also comes equipped with a powered Boss mode, two-spoke multifunction flat-bottom steering wheel, auto-dimming IRVM, ambient lighting, and a powered tailgate.",
      "Other notable features include a panoramic sunroof, reclining second row seats, frunk, EPB with auto-hold, and headrests for all occupants.",
      "The XEV 9S also gets four drive modes (Everyday, Race, Range, and Snow), five levels of regen, and a 150-litre frunk."
    ],
    "Powertrain": [
      "The new Mahindra XEV 9S gets the familiar 59kWh and 79kWh battery packs borrowed from the BE6 and XEV 9e siblings respectively.",
      "While the torque output remains the same at 380Nm for both variants, the power output is 228bhp and 282bhp for the smaller and larger battery packs respectively.",
      "Interestingly, there is a new 70kWh battery pack with a single electric motor.",
      "The latter produces 241bhp and 380Nm of torque.",
      "It is pitted to be the fastest seven-seater EV that can sprint from 0-100kmph in seven seconds."
    ]
  },
  "verdict": "The Mahindra XEV 9S is a feature-packed, spacious seven-seater electric SUV. It boasts a 679km driving range and 0-100kmph in 7 seconds. With a starting price of Rs. 19.95 lakh, it offers great value with a triple-screen setup, advanced safety features, and a panoramic sunroof. And though the third-row seating is a bit of a squeeze, the XEV9S can be a great electric seven-seater for extended families.",
