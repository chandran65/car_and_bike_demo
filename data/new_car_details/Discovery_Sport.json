  "expert_review": {
    "design_styling": "The Discovery Sport’s transformation is evident from the first glance. In keeping with Land Rover’s ethos, the design combines robustness with modern aesthetics. The fascia sees slimmer and sleeker LED headlights which not only give it a modern appearance but are said to also enhance visibility. The grille, with its honeycomb mesh design, adds a touch of elegance, making the SUV both rugged and sophisticated. Moving to the side, the sharp lines and aerodynamic design highlight Land Rover’s attention to detail. The rear continues the theme with minimal changes, but they blend perfectly with the vehicle’s overall look. Completing the look are the alloy wheels, which, although not the machine-cut ones seen internationally, still look classy."
  },
  "verdict": "The new Discovery Sport is also competitively priced and plusher than its predecessor, with notable improvements. It helps that the three-row configuration brings in that extra level of practicality over its rivals. For those looking at a luxurious yet functional highway mile muncher, the Land Rover Discovery Sport facelift is a capable all-rounder that absolutely needs to be on your consideration list.",
