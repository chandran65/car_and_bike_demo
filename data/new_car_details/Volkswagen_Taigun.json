  "expert_review": {
    "design_styling": "The Volkswagen Taigun has always been a looker and exudes a sophisticated charm. Its design philosophy seems to strike a healthy balance between boldness and elegance. While the absence of the GT badges subtly distinguishes this version from the 1.5-litre sibling, the vehicle doesn’t shy away from showcasing its lineage through the lavish use of chrome on the exterior. This includes the imposing front grille that stands as a testament to Volkswagen’s attention to detail, the door handles as well as the rear bumper. The LED headlights, apart from their utilitarian value, also add a modern flair to the vehicle’s face. Complementing the overall aesthetics are the 17-inch alloy wheels, which not only give the SUV a robust appearance but are also meticulously crafted to reflect the brand's legacy of precision and style."
  },
  "verdict": "Taigun has come like a breath of fresh air in the crowded and competitive compact SUV space in India. Despite the arrival of some newer models in 2022, the car has manged to hold own to its own, primarily because of its build quality, safety and drivability, especially with the bigger 1.5 litre turbo engine. At higher end though, it does feel a tad expensive which is a critical factor in the segment.",
