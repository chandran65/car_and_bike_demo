  "expert_review": {
    "design_styling": "The City 2023 offers two distinct aesthetic options: Elegance and Sporty. The Elegance trim retains the essence of the pre-facelift design, while the Sporty variant introduces more pronounced bumpers, a mesh grille, and faux carbon fiber-finished lower extensions. The fog lamp housings exhibit greater intricacy, and the rear bumper boasts a diffuser-like design. It's important to note that the Sporty trim is exclusive to the City e:HEV and the top-tier petrol trim (VX) and definitely offers a unique look in the segment. The City 2023 is able to maintain the sleek and balanced silhouette of its predecessor, with different alloy wheel choices being the only notable change in its profile. This facelift marginally enhances the already appealing aesthetics of the fifth-generation of the sedan, contributing to its premium look."
  },
  "verdict": "A premium, well loaded, and well designed car – fitting of the City nameplate. There are bits we could have been happier with, but there's plenty here to excite the segment. And the die-hard Honda City fan.",
