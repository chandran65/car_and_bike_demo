  "whats_new": {
    "Exterior": [
      "The new EX30 is built on Geely's Sustainable Experience Architecture (SEA) platform, which it shares with other cars like the Smart #1 and the Zeekr X. Though this platform allows for flexible and sustainable design, it reflects Volvo's modern and sleek new design language with the closed-off grille, slim LED headlamps, distinctive 'Thor's Hammer' headlamps, and EV-specific aero-optimised wheels. While it still looks similar to some of its siblings, the pixel-style LED tail lamps and a charging port on the left quarter panel are distinguishing elements."
    ],
    "Interior": [
      "The interior features a minimalist Swedish design with things centred around a 12.3-inch portrait-style infotainment screen. The latter runs on a Google-based OS that supports wired Android Auto and wireless Apple CarPlay. Then, there's a neatly laid-out dashboard as seen on other modern Volvo EVs like the EX90, new steering wheel, and a sleek driver’s instrumentation. Though an entry-level EV, the EX30 packs in an advanced safety suite with a 360-degree camera, multiple airbags, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assist) systems like lane-keeping assist and adaptive cruise control."
    ],
    "Powertrain": [
      "Globally, the EX30 is offered in multiple powertrain options. However, in India, Volvo is offering it in a single-motor version, with a powerful 268bhp rear-mounted motor mated with an LFP battery. The EV supports rapid charging with DC fast charging speeds of up to 150kW and a WLTP-claimed driving range of 480km."
    ]
  },
  "verdict": "The EX30 is India's entry-point to Volvo's EVs. It is a fun, fast, practical electric SUV with unique design, comfy ride, and advanced safety. It suits everyday and spirited driving, but might not suit chauffeur-driven needs due to tight rear space.",
