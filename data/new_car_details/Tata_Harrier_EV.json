  "whats_new": {
    "Introduction": [
      "The Tata Harrier EV is the brand's sixth electric model.",
      "Ex-showroom prices started at Rs. 21.49 lakh for the base variant.",
      "The most expensive is the top-spec QWD Stealth Edition.",
      "The latter is a special edition with exclusive paint scheme.",
      "Otherwise, it comes in three variants or personas as Tata Motors call it.",
      "There's sufficient differentiation between Adventure, Fearless, and Empowered, and a special Stealth Edition."
    ],
    "Exterior": [
      "The Harrier EV is the company's new electric flagship.",
      "It closely resembles the ICE version in design.",
      "Key distinguishing features include a blanked-out front grille, new bumpers, aero-efficient alloy wheels, and enhanced lighting with animations.",
      "The EV is offered in four colours, plus the Stealth edition.",
      "A bold stance and design identical to the ICE model make it interesting and practical."
    ],
    "Interior": [
      "Inside the Harrier EV is a nice sleek grey and white colour scheme.",
      "Its layout is like the ICE Harrier, but with added advanced features.",
      "The biggest highlight is the 14.5-inch Samsung Neo QLED touchscreen.",
      "The feature-rich cabin also features a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, JBL audio with Dolby Atmos, and a panoramic sunroof.",
      "Other key highlights include Level 2 ADAS, connected car tech with OTA updates, and a 'Summon' mode for limited vehicle movement through its key fob.",
      "The stand-out features include a 540-degree surround camera and a new DrivePay feature for FASTag and EV charging point payments."
    ],
    "Powertrain": [
      "The Tata Harrier EV is based on Tata's Acti.ev platform.It features a dual-motor setup giving it all-wheel-drive capabilities named as QWD.",
      "The lower variants get a 65kWh battery which powers a single electric motor producing 235bhp and sending this power to the rear wheels.Meanwhile, the higher variants are equipped with a bigger 75kWh battery pack and dual electric motors.",
      "Here the front motor delivers 155bhp and the rear churns out 235bhp, generating a cumulative 504Nm of torque.",
      "The Harrier EV can do the 0-100kmph sprint in just 6.3 seconds.Notably, the QWD tech gives it an all-terrain capability with four drive and six terrain modes."
    ]
  },
  "verdict": "The Tata Harrier EV is a compelling choice for prospective buyers looking for a high-riding EV. Especially with its good road presence, over 350km driving range, good comfort, performance, and off-road capability through QWD. However, it struggles with inconsistent quality, fit and finish, and tech issues, while top-spec variants come with a steep price (over Rs. 30 lakh). Yet the SUV manages to balance affordability, performance, and range, while it competes with Mahindra BE 6, XEV 9e, Hyundai Creta Electric, and Maruti e Vitara in a tough market that's only growing.",
