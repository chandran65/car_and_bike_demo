  "whats_new": {
    "Introduction": [
      "Tata Motors launched the refreshed edition of the Tiago in 2025 along with the Tiago.ev and the Tigor.",
      "Along with new looks and features, the hatchback gets several updates.",
      "While these upgrades keep the car relevant amidst the competition, the positives of the entry-level model continue to be offered."
    ],
    "Exterior": [
      "Up front now is a refreshed fascia that includes a revised grille and LED headlamps.",
      "The Tiago also gets chrome inserts on the air dam to add to the bling.",
      "With the 2025 model, the car started to get circular fog lamps with LED DRLs.",
      "Look closely and you'll notice that the hatchback also gets a new shark fin antenna.",
      "Small changes but these minimal updates make it look neater and more modern.",
      "That said, the Tiago continues to ride on the same 15-inch dual-tone alloy wheels as its predecessor."
    ],
    "Interior": [
      "Inside, the 2025 Tiago edition boasts a new steering wheel and an advanced instrument cluster.",
      "Then, there's a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.",
      "It now also gets USB Type-C charging ports, TPMS, and cruise control."
    ],
    "Powertrain": [
      "The newly launched Tiago remains mechanically identical to the outgoing version.",
      "This ICE version is powered by the same 1.2-litre three-cylinder petrol engine.",
      "This powerplant comes mated to either a five-speed manual or an AMT.",
      "Notably, customers can opt for a CNG option as well.",
      "However, the CNG variant is only offered with a manual gearbox."
    ]
  },
  "verdict": "The TATA Tiago is a great product for the price point. The only real improvement in the car and in the Tiago in general would be the addition of the touchscreen infotainment unit that does duty in the Tigor. Priced at Rs 5.35 lakh, ex-showroom, it makes sense for a wide range of customers who are looking for something that makes a great all round package. The Tiago is spacious, performs well and is built well to. It is most certainly a car we would recommend, especially if you are a first time car buyer or a first time automatic car buyer.",
