    "Introduction": [
      "The Mahindra XUV 3XO is another contender in the highly competitive compact SUV segment in India.",
      "It is essentially a revamped version of the XUV300 building on to the strengths of the outgoing car.",
      "In 2025, Mahindra brought in the 3XO REVX, which incorporates new variants that are not special editions.",
      "The REVX variants fill in the gap between existing variants offering more choices at different price points."
    ],
    "Exterior": [
      "A slight departure from the XUV300, cosmetic updates to the new XUV 3XO's fascia include new front and rear bumpers and revised LED headlamps.",
      "The silhouette remains largely the same with a compact footprint.",
      "However, the SUV now rides on a new set of alloy wheels and boasts new tail lamps.",
      "As for the REVX variants, there's a body-coloured front fascia for the grille.",
      "The standard variants get the piano black panel introduced earlier.",
      "With a black roof and black ORVMs, the REVX further enhances the dual-tone colour scheme.",
      "Moreover, the REVX rides on 16-inch blacked-out wheels, though the design pattern remains the same as the standard variants.",
      "To round it off, there are exclusive REVX badges on the C-pillars and the boot lid."
    ],
    "Interior": [
      "The Mahindra 3XO is a big step up inside as compared to the XUV300.",
      "Now, the compact SUV boasts new features such as a large touchscreen infotainment system, new steering wheel, and digital instrument cluster.",
      "Then, it has a revised centre console, automatic climate control, and a wireless charger.",
      "Other USPs include a 360-degree surround camera, Harman Kardon-sourced music system, front and rear parking sensors, panoramic sunroof, and an ADAS suite.",
      "Even the XUV 3XO REVX features a sporty two-tone interior with black and beige colours.",
      "Its equipment includes leatherette seat upholstery with contrast stitching and aluminium pedals."
    ],
    "Powertrain": [
      "The XUV 3XO continues to be offered with a choice of petrol and diesel powertrains.",
      "As for the standard petrol model buyers, there's a 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine producing 109bhp and 200Nm of torque.",
      "But for enthusiasts, there's even a more powerful TGDi version producing 129bhp and 230Nm of torque.",
      "For diesel lovers, there’s a 1.5-litre motor tuned to churn out 115bhp and 300Nm of torque.",
      "Gearbox options include a six-speed manual, six-speed torque converter automatic, and a six-speed AMT.",
      "Mechanically, the XUV 3XO REVX is identical to the standard version.",
      "However, it is offered only with 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine options.",
      "These come mated to either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission."
