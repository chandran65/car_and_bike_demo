  "expert_review": {
    "design_styling": "BYD has evidently opted for a ‘less is more’ philosophy when it comes to the Atto 3’s exterior design. The aesthetic doesn’t scream for attention but rather woos you with its subtlety. One is instantly struck by the grille-less front fascia, which is becoming increasingly popular among electric vehicles. However, BYD has given its version a tasteful minimalism, devoid of any flamboyance. The tasteful chrome strip with the brand’s badge is a classic touch, although one could argue that a blacked-out version might give it a sportier aura. The car's LED headlamps add a modern flair, even if their luminosity could be improved for more effective night time driving. The angular air dams not only serve as an aesthetic element but also enhance aerodynamics. The profile strikes a balance between sophistication and sportiness, particularly with the chic 18-inch alloy wheels and the textured pattern on the C-Pillar. While the front may be somewhat understated, the rear gets a bit more expressive with its eye-catching wraparound LED tail lights."
