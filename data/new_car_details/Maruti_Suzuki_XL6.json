  "verdict": "The XL6 is a welcome addition to the Maruti Suzuki family. Could it have been better? Yes. But it is still a car I see plenty of families and individuals adopting. The pricing is fairly attractive sitting just a bit higher than the Ertiga's but with a good chunk of equipment as standard. It may not be as big as the Innova, and perhaps remains a tad lower on premiumness. But its ride quality and feature list, plus its styling and pricing will get people in to check out Nexa's first 3-row car.",
