  "whats_new": {
    "Introduction": [
      "Renault launched the Triber facelift in India in July 2025, with prices starting at Rs. 6.29 lakh (ex-showroom).",
      "The updated version gets four variants – Authentic, Evolution, Techno, and Emotion.",
      "Apart from this new nomenclature, the MPV gets an array of cosmetic enhancements and some new features.",
      "This compact MPV was long overdue for an update since its launch six years ago in the country."
    ],
    "Exterior": [
      "The Triber's latest iteration sports a refreshed design with a gloss black grille.",
      "Even the headlight clusters are revamped with integrated LED DRLs and a reworked bumper.",
      "While the silhouette remains identical to the outgoing version, the MPV now rides on 15-inch flex wheels.",
      "The latter are smartly designed and a close look reveals that these are wheel covers which look like alloy wheels.",
      "On to the Triber's rear section, it now boasts smoked LED tail lights with a central black strip.",
      "The carmaker has also added a 'Triber' lettering on the boot lid.",
      "Another thing that goes without saying is the brand's latest diamond logo."
    ],
    "Interior": [
      "The three-row MPV's cabin has a layout identical to the outgoing model with a dual-tone dashboard.",
      "But now there’s a new eight-inch floating touchscreen infotainment system, which supports wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.",
      "Other notable features include an LED instrument cluster, new seat upholstery, and an LED cabin lighting.",
      "Safety has been further enhanced with standard equipment including six airbags, ESP, TPMS, and EBD with Brake Assist.",
      "Moreover, Renault has added front parking sensors, which is a segment-first feature."
    ],
    "Powertrain": [
      "The latest Renault Triber retains its 1.0-litre, three-cylinder petrol engine.",
      "There's no turbo-power and this NA mill produces 71bhp and 96Nm of torque.",
      "This powerplant comes mated to either a five-speed manual or a five-speed AMT system.",
      "Customers also have the choice of a government-approved CNG retrofitment kit."
    ]
  },
  "verdict": "It has USPs many of you may not think you need - but actually do. And so while it may not seem like an appealing enough car at the start, it's the kind I suspect that will grow on you. It is practical, cavernously roomy, and yet has quick cooling cabin, it's efficient; and while the engine is no fire starter, it certainly is not underpowered.",
