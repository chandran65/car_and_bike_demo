  "expert_review": {
    "design_styling": "Hyundai's Venue boldly sets itself apart with an eye-catching design, a significant advantage in the crowded subcompact SUV category. Its front end features a dominant cascading grille, with the option of chrome or black accents, depending on the variant. The sleek headlamps come equipped with LED DRLs and projector lamps, while the triangular housing for fog lamps adds an extra element of character. The muscular side profile, complete with flared wheel arches, roof rails, and diamond-cut alloy wheels, reinforces its commanding presence. The squared-off tailgate, LED tail lamps, and skid plate contribute to its visual appeal. In addition, the Sport trim features distinctive elements like red brake calipers, red grille and wheel arch accents, as well as \"Sport\" badging on the C-pillar."
  },
  "verdict": "The Venue boasts a practical interior, striking looks, abundant features, competitive pricing, and a diverse range of powertrain choices, making it a formidable contender in the fiercely competitive compact SUV market.",
