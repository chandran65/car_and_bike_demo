    "design_styling": "At first glance, the Virtus commands attention. A harmonious blend of sporty dynamism and refined elegance, its design is a testament to Volkswagen’s attention to detail. The chrome accents, while generous, are tastefully placed, ensuring the car doesn’t come across as overly flashy. What sets the 1.5-litre TSI apart are subtle yet impactful touches like the GT badging, which is cleverly placed on the grille, profile, and the rear. The front end, adorned with a single slat grille, LED headlamps, and L-shaped LED DRLs, exudes a sense of assertiveness. There’s a hint of nostalgia too, as the design is reminiscent of the belovedVolkswagen Jetta. The color options, especially the Wild Cherry Red andCurcuma Yellow, are not just shades but character elements that define the car's personality. The distinctive alloy wheels, especially the blacked-out ones on the 1.5-litre TSI, complement the car’s athletic stance, making the Virtus a head-turner on roads."

  "verdict": "The compact sedan segment in India is undergoing an influx of fresher models with the Skoda Slavia and the hybrid version of the Honda City taking the fight straight to Maruti Suzuki Ciaz and the Hyundai Verna Volkswagen now has brought in the replacement to the VW Vento and yes it looks gorgeous. With a car like the Virtus, that is high on looks, features and two powerful petrol engines, Volkswagen might just hit it out of the park with the pricing.",
