    "question": "What is a car loan?",
    "answer": "A car loan is a borrowing instrument that a lender such as a bank or NBFC (non-banking financial company) provides an individual allowing him/her to purchase a car. Car loans have gained popularity in recent times as instead of being a luxury item or a symbol of status, cars have grown to become an essential commodity for the continuously growing middle class of India. With the increased popularity of car loans, most banks and NBFCs currently offer this type of loan to individuals who have a good credit history. One point to keep in mind regarding a car loan is the fact that this loan invests in a depreciating asset i.e. the asset (car) bought using this loan is in fact going to cost less over time.",

    "question": "Do I need collateral for a car loan?",
    "answer": "Just as the name suggests, a car loan is a loan granted to an individual interested in buying a car. Therefore a car loan is a secured loan where the car you buy acts as a collateral. Therefore, there is no additional collateral requirement for a car loan. However, you do have to get the RC (registration certificate) of the car endorsed with the bank. This endorsement is cancelled after repayment of the loan is completed.",

    "question": "What is the difference between a fixed rate and a floating rate car loan?",
    "answer": "In case of a fixed rate car loan, the rate of interest applicable on the car loan remains the same over a period of time. Therefore fixed rate car loans have a specific EMI payout requirement that does not change due to market conditions. In case of a floating rate car loan, the applicable interest rate of the car loan varies periodically as per the decision of the lender. Thus the payable EMI on a floating rate loan may change from time to time.",

    "answer": "Yes, you can negotiate the interest rate applicable to your car loan by leveraging your credit history and prior relationship with the prospective lender.

  {
    "question": "How does the implementation of MCLR change the car loan EMI?",
    "answer": "As per the RBI directive, from April 2016 onwards, banks are using MCLR (marginal cost of lending rate) to fix the interest rate on various loans including car loans. Currently the MCLR-based car loan rates are slightly lower than the base rate method that banks used earlier. However, changes in CRR, margin, bank operating expenses and deposit interest rates will change the MCLR and by extension the interest rates offered on car loans. Moreover, as per the new regulations, banks are required to revise their loan interest rates every 6 months or on a yearly basis.",

    "question": "Can I get financing for insurance and registration?",
    "answer": "Car loans do not cover the insurance or registration fees that you have to pay at the time of buying the vehicle. Car insurance , which is mandatory, needs to be purchased separately and all vehicle registration-related costs also have to be borne by you as they are not covered by your car loan.

    "answer": "No. Lenders who provide car loans to individuals only allow the car to be sold to a new owner when the loan has been paid off in full.

    "question": "What if I don’t pay EMIs on time?",
    "answer": "Generally, banks treat you as a defaulter if you fail to pay two or more EMIs in a timely manner. You will initially be charged a penalty fee and asked to regularise your payments. If you fail to regularise your payments after repeated notifications, the financial institution can legally repossess your vehicle.

  {
    "question": "Why are zero percent financing car models more expensive than the other ones?",
    "answer": "As the manufacturer is liable to pay the interest component of the car loan, the manufacturer would have to maintain a higher profit margin on the sale. That is the reason why, the cost of zero financing car models is usually greater than the cost of car models that do not have this feature.",

    "answer": "There are usually quite a few terms and conditions in case of zero financing options that are not usually applicable in case of a standard car loan. For example, the usual tenure of a zero financing loan ranges from 12 months to 15 months hence your premium payments will be much higher than that in case of a standard car loan.
